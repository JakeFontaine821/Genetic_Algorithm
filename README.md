# Genetic_Algorithm
Language - Java

A Genetic Algorithm written in java utilizing physics algorithms for projectile motion.
Gene uses height of launch and velocity to determine how long in air and distance traveled before hitting the ground (ignoring wind resistance).
Generational success is reached once it hits a bullseye.
